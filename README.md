# Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN :
This is completely a deep learning project entirely based on neural networks and I think Facial emotion recognition(FER) project is one of the classical projects in deep learning.<br/>
<br/>We all know facial emotions play a vital role in our day-to-day life. so, we need a system which is capable of recognising our  facial emotions and able to act accordingly.
This project maybe the first step in that system.


<br/>
Here we train a convolutional neural network with kaggle facial emotions dataset so it is able to detect emotions in a image
<br/>
_Feel free to download, clone , fork the project._ 
## Installation of python libraries:
  * keras with tensorflow as backend
  * OpenCV
  * numpy
  * pandas
  * matplotlib


## DataSet:
In this project I used kaggle dataset i.e  <br/>
  https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/overview
  <br/>
    we can use a kaggle API to access and download that dataset.

## Usage:
This project is in notebook format. I wrote the program in google colabs.
<br/><br/>
**Google colabs** is a cloud based notebook IDE which offers a free GPU and allows us to write python code snippets with ease.
It is almost similar to jupyter notebook but slight variations.
Some of the code snippets in the program is specific to google colabs. Dont get confuse.
<br/>
<br/>
In the notebook, I  explain all the concepts, pipeline , terminology , functions which is involved in the program in a clear and concised manner. 
Even I also mention some of my insights , intuitions and observations in the project.<br/>
I document almost everything  that is used in the  program.<br/>
This notebook file is a complete wrapout  of practical exposure, understanding and theory.
